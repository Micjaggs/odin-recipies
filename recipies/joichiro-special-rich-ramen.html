        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Joichiro is a breakfast ramen dish. It is unusual to make ramen for breakfast.  This ramen dish is relatively light, making it perfect for breakfast.
            It looks like it has meat, but ideally, it is meatless. Instead, the Joichiro use tempeh, a meat substitute. Tempe goes well with miso soup-based vegetarian broth and soy milk. 
            The dish also has dried shiitake mushrooms that bring out meaty umami, some potatoes, and vegetables. It has ginger, garlic, and seasonings that make it tremendously delicious.
            Because of the tempeh, the ramen ends up having a meaty flavor without all the heaviness. As a result, it is revitalizing and energizing. This makes it a perfect dish to start your day with.</p>
