        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Char Okakiage is a dish made by Sōma Yukihira on the first day of the Tōtsuki Friendship and Rapport Training Camp. Sōma improvised the dish by using a char that he fished from the river and kaki seeds provided by Hinako Inui. Using kaki seeds to serve as the batter's coating for a deep fried char, this is a dish you won't find on the Restaurant Yukihira menu!
