            <h3>Steps</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Use a pair of kitchen scissors to remove the two bones inside each of the 16 chicken wing. Mix 2 tablespoons each sake and soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of sugar.</li>
                <li>Dice the 1/8 head of cabbage, 1/2 bundle of leeks and 2-3 shiitake mushrooms. Grate the 2 thumbs of ginger and the 2 clove's of garlic. Chop the 4 slices of pork jowl into small pieces.</li>
                <li>Mix the ground pork and the pork jowl in a bowl until the mixture looks whiteish. Add 1 tablespoon each of potato starch, soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil and 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce and thoroughly mix together. Then add in the cabbage, leeks, shiitake, mushrooms, garlic, and ginger and mix again.</li>
                <li>Take the chicken wings from step 1. Stuff with 1/16th of the mixture from step 3 and pinch closed. Repeat it for all 16 wings</li>
                <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet or a frying pan. Place the wings from step 4 in the pan, skin-side up, and fry until the bottoms are browned. Flip them over skin-side down and dust with 60 grams of powdered cheese. Pour in the 100cc of water, cover and turn down to low heat. Let steam for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once all the water has steamed of and the wings are cooked through, remove from heat and plate them browned-side up. (Drizzle with the sweet and sour sauce if desired. They can be especially delicious as a Donburi Rice Bowl when put on top of white rice and drizzled with sauce.)</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Sweet & Sour Sauce</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Put 2 tablespoons each of vinegar, sugar and ketchup and 2 teaspoon each of soy sauce and chicken bouillon, 200cc of water, 1 tablespoon of potato starch, and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil into a pot and stir together well. </li>
                <li>Heat until boiling. Stir the mixture until thickened.</li>
            </ol>
